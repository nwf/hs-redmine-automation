CSV Schema Notes
================

In addition to the data provided by the school (or whoever it is), we add five columns
through some magical process that is not clear to this author (i.e. nwf):

  * Reviewer A Email
  * Reviewer A Name
  * Reviewer B Email
  * Reviewer B Name
  * Box URL

Reviewer A should be a *student* and reviewer B should be *faculty*.  The import script
(below) depends on this when it picks assignees, trying reviewer B first.

Using csvRedmine.hs
===================

One-time Setup
--------------

sudo apt-get install ghc cabal-install happy alex libz-dev
cabal update
cabal install wreq conduit cassava-conduit

Running
-------

Review your proposed changes, if you like::

  runghc csvRedmine.hs \
    -h https://clsp-redmine.cs.jhu.edu \
    -a $your_auth_token \
    -p $project_name \
    upsert -n < foo.csv

Commit your changes to the server:

  runghc csvRedmine.hs \
    -h https://clsp-redmine.cs.jhu.edu \
    -a $your_auth_token \
    -p $project_name \
    upsert -x < foo.csv

The ``-x`` indicates that we should clobber existing entries; leave it off if
you are just out to create new ones.
